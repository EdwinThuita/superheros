# Description
- #### live link = [Superheroes](https://spheroes.onrender.com)

-This api is designed to manage database of different `superheroes `and their `powers`. 
- It has three main resources: `Hero`, `Power`, and `HeroPower`.
- `Hero `model represents a `superhero `that possess one or more `powers` while power model represents the different types of `powers` that a superhero can have. 
- The `HeroPower` model acts as a join table between the `hero` and the `power` model, hence allowing for relations between the two.

-The API allows users to perform **CRUD** operations such as **adding** new `heroes` and `powers`, updating and **deleting** existing heroes and powers. Users can also associate specific powers with a hero by creating a new HeroPower entry.

# Tables

# Tables

| Heroes      | powers      | HeroPower         |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------------- |
| id (**pk**) | id (**pk**) | id (**pk**)       |
| name        | name        | hero_id (**FK**)  |
| super_name  | description | power_id (**FK**) |

-This diagram shows the relationships between the `Heroes`, `Powers`, and `HeroPowers` tables. The `Heroes` table has a **many-to-many** relationship with the `Powers` table, as each hero can have multiple `powers`, and each `power` can belong to multiple `heroes`. The `HeroPowers` table acts as a bridge table between `Heroes` and `Powers`, allowing for the **many-to-many** relationship between them.
